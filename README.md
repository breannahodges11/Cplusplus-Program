# Cplusplus-Program
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to build an item-tracking program using C++ and Python.  I started with a starter code for both C++ and Python and had to add to that code to create my program.  This project read a text file to create a list of all items purchased in a day along with the number of times the item was purchased, created a histogram listing the items purchased and amount of times, and takes an input of a particular item and returns how many times that item was purchased.

•	What did you do particularly well?
I think the program overall was done pretty well.  I liked the way I was able to incorporate color to make the program look better for the user.  The C++ code is organized into functions and in the main I only call one function to make it simpler to read and understand.

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One of the main things I wanted to do was improve the look of the program, such as showing options for user input of option 2 and capitalizing the first letter of the output to make it look more professional.

•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
One part of the code I had the most problems with was the switch case.  There was a lot more that went into it than I originally thought.  It also took a while for me to get the spacing right for the menus.  When I got irritated or stuck, I got up and took a break from the program.  I would change one part and run the program until I figured out.  Taking each section and changing or adding one small thing is much easier than trying to do it all at one time.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Connecting C++ and Python will be very valuable to other projects where I have to connect different programming languages.  Reading and creating text files will also be useful in other projects.

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I put everything in functions to make it easier to read and understand.  It also makes it much easier to change if anything needs to be changed.
